**Authtoken in header:**

   **Advantages:**
   Protects against authorisation issues - Attacker has no access to the token
   Protects against Cross Site Request Forgery attacks as header values cannot be appended directly by a malicious request originating from other domain.
   Protects against Cross Origin Resource Sharing - Because custom header is not sent even if Access-Control-Allow-Credentials value is set to true.

   **Disadvantages:** 
   Header size is limited.
   Mostly Single Page applications store token in local storage making it suspectible to leak via Cross Site Scripting attack.
   Value not encrypted by browser

**Authtoken in body:**

   **Advantages:**
   Protects against authorisation issues - Attacker has no access to the token
   Protects against Cross Site Request Forgery attacks as header values cannot be appended directly by a malicious request originating from other domain.
   Protects against Cross Origin Resource Sharing - Because custom header is not sent even if Access-Control-Allow-Credentials value is set to true.
   Token size is not limited as compared to header and cookie value.

   **Disadvantages:**
   Tokens can be leaked via Cross Site Scripting attack.

**Authtoken in cookie:**

      **Advantages:**
      Protects against authorisation issues - Attacker has no access to the token
      Protects against XSS if HTTPOnly flag is set for cookie
      Protects token to be transmitted over non HTTPS channel by setting the cookie attribute to secure.
      Encrypted by browsers. 

      **Disadvantages:**
      Vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery as cookies are automatically appended in request by another malicious domain opened in same browser session, additional anti-CSRF token or same site cookie attribute 
      is required in post body for protection. If we use the authtoken token only then again the risk of it being leaked via XSS.
      Vulnerable to CORS attack as cookies are automatically appended if Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true, added measures for origin header needed.
      Cookie size is limited.
